<h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Founded February 2016, Lavandula Fields was founded after our owner, Eric, had inhereted the farm from their late grandfather. They moved out of the city, and began to fix up the farm by themselves and the help of the rural neighborhood. From there, our owner had gotten married, had a lovely family pet and from there began to sell the lavender we have in our shop now.</p>
